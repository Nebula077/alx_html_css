# CSS Advanced - SmilesSchool Landing (Practice)

A clean, responsive landing page built to practice advanced CSS layout and visual design techniques. The project reproduces a modern homepage with a large hero background, overlay, instructor showcase, testimonials, popular tutorial cards, a free-membership feature area, FAQ, and footer.

Key features
- Hero section with background image and overlay
- Centered headline and primary CTA with purple accent
- Instructor "Learn from the pros" row inside hero area
- Testimonial block with gradient background
- Responsive tutorial cards with play overlay and ratings
- Free membership feature area with centered CTA
- FAQ grid and a structured footer with logo and social icons

Files of interest
- `index.html` — page markup
- `style.css` — main stylesheet (styles for layout, hero, cards, footer)
- `images/` — all image assets used by the page (avatars, thumbnails, icons)

How to view locally
1. Open `css_advanced/index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's "Open in Browser").
2. Ensure the `style.css` and the `images/` folder remain next to `index.html` so paths resolve correctly.

Notes & suggestions
- Fonts: this project uses system fonts; add Google Fonts (e.g., Poppins) for exact typography.
- Accessibility: add alt text to images and ensure color contrast for WCAG compliance.
- Deployment: upload the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify) to share the page.
